      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Guido Van Rossum's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1956</strong> - Van Rossum was born and raised in the Netherlands</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1982</strong> - he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1974</strong> - He received a bronze medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1986</strong> - While working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Van Rossum wrote and contributed a glob() routine to BSD Unix
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1989</strong> - Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby' programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers". He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)".[31]

            He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL, noting that ABC co-developer Lambert Meertens had "spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design".
          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>from 1987 till 1999</strong> -He has worked for various research institutes, including the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2000</strong> - he left CNRI along with three other Python core developers to work for tech startup BeOpen.com, which subsequently collapsed by October of the same year..
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From late 2000 until 2003</strong> he worked for Zope Corporation. In 2003 Van Rossum left Zope for Elemental Security. While there he worked on a custom programming language for the organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From 2005 till 2012,</strong> Van Rossum worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. At Google, he developed Mondrian, a web-based code review system written in Python and used within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.[20] He named Rietveld, another related software project, after Gerrit Rietveld, a Dutch designer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2012</strong>  Van Rossum left Google.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of benevolent dictator for life of the Python programming language.
          </li>

          <strong>2019</strong> -Van Rossum left Dropbox and officially retired.
        </li>
